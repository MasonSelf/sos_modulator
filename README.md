This is a module that adheres to the [JUCE Module Format](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/blob/master/docs/JUCE%20Module%20Format.md).

### Features
* [Curve Adjuster](https://github.com/MasonSelf/sos_curve_adjuster) to draw modulation shape.
* Blend between sync / free rate phases, rather than a binary choice between the two.
